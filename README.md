# test Matrix

The task is to write two classes in C++: a matrix class and a vector class. 
- matrixes and vectors shall be able to be multiplied;
- addition and scalar multiplication shall be supported as well; 
- nonlinear algebra functions are sought for (e.g. inverse, linear solving, svd etc.). 

# result

- This is the Eclipse CDT project;
- contain 2 classes: CMyMatrix and CMyVector as required;
- if the input parameters are incorrect (for example the matrix size) the library will throw the `std::runtime_error` exception;
- the project contains C++ test framework Catch2 for unit-testing (attached as *.hpp file);
- the file `test_Matrix.cpp` used for tests specification.
